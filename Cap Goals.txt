1. My first goal is to implement the Test Driven Development to the fullest in the current implementation of Pipeline as Code.
   While implementation of Test Cases make sure all corner cases are covered. The overall code coverage should be greater than 90%.
	

2. Be an effective team player. The principal of One Team should be always kept in mind. Taking directions from the senior colleagues, 
   learning from them and also training and mentoring the new associates. This would help in maintaining the agility of team and also 
   increase the ability of the team to deliver on time.

3. Constantly try to engage with the customer and be one of the imporatnt person of contact for the customer. This will make sure for 
   ensuring that communication with the client remains smooth and interaction with the client remain positive which will in turn provision
   concise requirement gathering and client feedback at every step of development. Thus, a finsished product will be easily deliverable.

4. Develop a pipeline on my own. This will help me gain a lot of knowledge about the development cycle involved for a fully functional CI/CD
   pipeline. The development should be done by keeping in mind test driven development as well as other features such as the ability of
   the pipeline to be dynamic, scalable and available.
